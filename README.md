# SRA_allele_search   
Search your favorite alleles in your favorite organisms in SRA database   

**Usage:**   

Copy this repository:   
```
git clone https://github.com/SichongP/SRA_variant_search
cd SRA_variant_search
```
Make a working directory:   
```
mkdir working
cd working
```
Prepare list of accessions of genomes to look for and a list of variants of interest   
*more on this later*   


Run with matching breeds at end:
```
python ../fetch -f variant_list -b breed_list --breeds=True --out output
```

Or, run without matching breeds:
```
python ../fetch -f variant_list --out output
```

Or use a single region instead of a list:   
```
python ../fetch -r chr1:123-456 -a SraRunInfo.csv --out output
```

Note:     
-a is optional. When not supplied, fetch will look for a file names "SraRunInfo.csv" at current working directory.   
-out is optional. When not supplied, fetch will output to file "autogenerated_allele_calling_(date).csv"
